# Arsenal+ with Hyperspace Translation release
From here you can download the latest translated Arsenal+ with Hyperspace(ARS+), an overhaul mod for FTL: Faster Than Light. 

Do NOT patch this mod with FTL: Multiverse, another overhaul mod for FTL.

## Manual Installation
We assume that you have already downgraded FTL and installed Hyperspace, and that you can install mods using the Slipstream Mod Manager(SMM). If you have not yet done so, follow the [Official Hyperspace Installation Guide](https://ftl-hyperspace.github.io/FTL-Hyperspace/#installation)

### 1. Downgrade FTL to 1.6.9
See [Hyperspace Guide](https://ftl-hyperspace.github.io/FTL-Hyperspace/#installation)
### 2. Install Hyperspace
See [Hyperspace Guide](https://ftl-hyperspace.github.io/FTL-Hyperspace/#installation)
### 3. Download and patch translated Arsenal+.
Find the package in your language below and click it to download. It is named as `Arsenal-Plus-With-Hyperspace-<ARS+ version>-<your lang code>+xxxxxxx.ftl`.

> Example: English ARS+ with version 1.13 is  `Arsenal-Plus-With-Hyperspace-1.13-en+e473865.ftl`

After downloading, place the file in the mods folder in the SMM folder.

Run `modman.exe` or `modman.jar`, then check the checkbox of the mod you want to install. The mod order is very important.

The mod order should be:
```
| Translated ARS+(This mod)
|
| Any other ARS+ addon(optional)
|
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Do NOT patch original ARS+ files with translated ARS+.

Run FTL and select your language in options. Now you can play ARS+ in your mother tongue!
