  "Shortly after your arrival, a Lanius ship jumps near the beacon. It begins to move slowly toward you. You open wide band communication channels, attempting to make contact. However, it either ignores you or is unable to receive the messages. As they get closer you issue the order to charge weapons and find they do the same.": "你刚到达不久，一艘拉尼厄斯战舰就跃迁到了信标附近。它开始慢慢地接近你。你开启了宽频信道，尝试联系对方。但是，他们并未回应，要么是他们无视了你的通信，要么就是没有收到你的消息。他们越来越近，你下达了给武器充能的命令，你发现他们也在给武器充能。",

As you consider this, a much larger Lanius vessel moves in to engage you, and the scout ships scatter in all directions.": "信标周围全是微型拉尼厄斯飞行器，看样子每个飞行器只能装下一人。或许他们是某种先遣侦察队，目的是寻找“金属机会”？就在你思考的时候，一艘大得多的拉尼厄斯战舰朝你袭来，那些侦察飞船四散开来。",

The civilian wastes no time and jumps away, but that appears only to harden the pirate's resolve.": "似乎有艘海盗船正在威胁信标附近的一艘难民飞船。看见你跃迁过来，那海盗船转而向你飞来。那些平民没浪费任何时间，迅速跃迁走了，看到这一幕，海盗们似乎更加坚定了找你麻烦的决心。",

  "When you arrive at the beacon you discover what must have been remnants of a large battle. However the vast majority of metal has been stripped from the ships, only various plastic and other materials float in a ring around a planet. A lone Lanius ship moves between the wreckage looking for more salvage.": "抵达信标时你发现，这里残留着许多残骸，一定是某场大型战役留下的。然而，大多数的金属都已经被搜刮得一干二净了，仅剩下一些塑料和其他材料聚成一环围绕着一颗行星漂浮。一艘落单的拉尼厄斯战舰正在残骸中来回穿梭，寻找能回收的东西。",

Yet another area sucked dry by the Lanius.": "图表数据显示，这里曾是一次小规模战斗的战场，双方曾在此争夺附近一颗卫星上的一座军事设施。奇怪的是，扫描结果上没有发现任何残骸，战斗或空间站所留下的残骸均消失得无影无踪。这里一定是另一处被拉尼厄斯人吸收的区域。",
  "Scans show no signs of any ships or settlements nearby. You have no way of knowing if the area was always uninhabited or if it was simply erased by the Lanius.": "扫描结果显示附近没有任何飞船或定居点。你无法判断这片区域是原本就无人定居还是被拉尼厄斯人抹掉了。",

Fortunately the Lanius moved on after briefly scanning the civilian ships, leaving them more than a little shaken up.": "几艘避难飞船正准备踏上前往其他星区的漫长旅途。他们向你讲述了当时的场景：数艘拉尼厄斯战舰包围了他们，然后开始入侵他们的超光速引擎。万幸的是，拉尼厄斯人在粗略扫描这些平民飞船后就离开了，把这些平民吓得不轻。",
  "You pass a civilian ship that warns of the nearby Lanius. \"One of them attacked a civilian transport and started to melt their fracking hull. But then the weirdest thing happened... another metal ship actually fired on its companion until it backed off.\" Apparently there are disagreements among the Lanius about what should be salvaged.": "你在一艘平民飞船旁通过，他们警告你附近有拉尼厄斯人。“他们的一艘战舰攻击了另一艘平民运输船，然后开始熔化运输船破损的船体。但随后发生了一件最不可思议的事：另外一艘金属战舰居然向自己的同伴开火了，直到后者撤离。”很显然，关于该回收什么这件事情上，拉尼厄斯人之间也存在分歧。",
  "You question a local settlement and they describe a fleet of metal ships wordlessly collecting all of the abandoned metal and debris in the area. When they approached important satellites, the settlements fired a few ASB warning shots. The Lanius moved on despite clearly having the firepower to overwhelm the settlements.": "你询问了一处本地定居点，他们描述说，有一支金属战舰组成的舰队正一言不发地收集这片区域中所有废弃的金属以及飞船残骸。他们曾靠近过一颗很重要的人造卫星，这定居点警告性地发射了几轮反舰炮。尽管可以不费吹灰之力地用火力压制这定居点，但那些拉尼厄斯人却离开了。",
  "You come across a human civilian ship preparing to leave the sector. They message you, \"We're getting out of here! There was some cult rambling about the spreading of the disease, Humanitis.

Traders.\" Apparently some merchants emigrated with the scavengers.": "你到达并发现一些曼提斯飞船停靠在一个貌似空间站的地方。你急着离开，但他们用你的语言给你发来消息，让你松了一口气。“买东西？卖东西？商人。”显然是一些商人与拾荒者一起移居了。",
